# game2
A learning-driven 2D pixel-art UE 5 game for mobile


# What is game2?
It's a temporary name for a short and beautiful, non-addictive pixel-art game with simple mechanics designed to be a one-time 'consumable' experience for a child. 

# Why do I want to make game2?
There are many games out there for kids, and unfortunately many of them are designed to profit and prey on children's short attention span. That’s why, I would like to create a game which teaches some skills and values while telling a short, enjoyable story. I'd like it to have a simple narrative and introduce basic controls through a minimal interface. (I also started my computer science degree and I want to have projects done in parallel with the course to include in my portfolio.) 

# What is the core game loop?
- A character walks to the right (side-scrolling game) and bumps into an obstacle.
- A player clicks/taps a key and the character overcomes the obstacle.
- The sequence repeats with a variety of obstacles and fresh mechanics layered in. 

# Game mechanics progression
It is a side scroller game with obstacles/challenges to surpass. The character, the child moves, walks or runs from the left to the right side of the screen and the camera follows. The character bumps into an obstacle and in order to overcome it, the only action the player has to take is clicking/tapping anywhere on the screen.
Later, the User learns that if timed correctly, the the character will jump over, not walk through the obstacle and increase the pace that it gets to another obstacle. The pace is increased to a limit and then if the User is comfortable with timing the jump the game will introduce another mechanic, like click and hold to surpass a different type of obstacle. If the User fails to react to the new mechanic, the child will either fall, or just stop and ponder about the obstacle. Obstacle mechanic will be introduced and explained with animated 'clicks' or 'taps' in the game’s HUD.

# Narrative
The game follows a young 2-3 year old through a walk in the park. The child walks in a usual toddler way, often tripping and being imbalanced. When running, its shoulders go up and arms straighten out. While walking, it bumps into different kinds of obstacles, or points of interest. It can be a worm sticking out from the ground, a little gap in pavement tiles, a puddle, a beautiful leaf, a mushroom, a piece of trash, or anything the child may find amusing. There is no way of losing in the game. The child will never go back; it can stop and ponder about its findings, walk or run forward.
The game doesn't tell it immediately but there are parents and a sibling that cheer for a young child along the way. When the child falls, a parent, or a sibling will walk up and help the child up and cheer up. Sometimes a child will control its own emotions without anybody's help and continue with determination.
The game shows the curious nature of a 2–3-year-old and the struggle of a younger sibling, fighting for their parents’ attention with the older sibling. The moral will show that the child doesn’t need to fight at all, because both parents and the sibling are always there.
